# Development harness

The mod ships a development-only command channel so a shell script can run a load-and-check cycle against the running game without simulating keyboard or mouse input: load a level, capture the game's own rendered frame, and quit. It is driven by `scripts/run.py`.

## Enabling

The harness is off by default. It runs only if the marker file `<game dir>/harness/enabled` exists when the game starts, so a normal install exposes no command channel.

```sh
uv run scripts/run.py enable    # creates harness/enabled and harness/commands
uv run scripts/run.py disable   # removes the marker
```

Enabling takes effect on the next game launch. When active, the mod logs `DevHarness: enabled, watching '<dir>'` to `MelonLoader/Latest.log`.

The game directory is resolved the same way as in `scripts/game_paths.py`: process environment, then the nearest `.env` found walking up from the current directory or the script, then the built-in default: the CrossOver Steam bottle (`~/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/Steam/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Megabonk`) on macOS, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Megabonk` on Windows. The keys are `MEGABONK_GAME_DIR` (the game directory itself) and `MEGABONK_BOTTLE` (a bottle's `drive_c`).

## Commands

`run.py` writes one JSON file per command into `<game dir>/harness/commands/`. The mod polls that folder twice a second, runs the files in name order, and moves each one to `harness/done/` (accepted) or `harness/rejected/` (unparseable). A command is moved before it runs, so a command that crashes or quits the game is never replayed.

| Command | Wire format | `run.py` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load a level and start the run | `{"command":"load-level","path":"<file>"}` | `run.py load <level>` |
| Save the rendered frame as a PNG | `{"command":"screenshot","path":"<file>"}` | `run.py screenshot <out.png>` |
| Freeze gameplay | `{"command":"freeze"}` | `run.py freeze` |
| Resume gameplay | `{"command":"resume"}` | `run.py resume` |
| Make the player survive enemy damage | `{"command":"invulnerable"}` | `run.py invulnerable` |
| Restore normal player damage | `{"command":"vulnerable"}` | `run.py vulnerable` |
| Start the kill-floor heartbeat | `{"command":"heartbeat-on"}` | `run.py heartbeat on` |
| Stop the kill-floor heartbeat | `{"command":"heartbeat-off"}` | `run.py heartbeat off` |
| Hold the camera at a pose | `{"command":"camera","position":[x,y,z],"rotation":[rx,ry,rz]}` | `run.py camera X Y Z --rot RX RY RZ` |
| Return the camera to the game | `{"command":"camera-clear"}` | `run.py camera --clear` |
| Quit the game | `{"command":"quit"}` | `run.py quit` |

`run.py cycle <level> <out.png>` runs load, waits `--settle` seconds (default 5), takes the screenshot, then quits. `--invulnerable` makes the player invulnerable right after the load, before the settle wait. `--freeze` freezes gameplay and `--camera X Y Z RX RY RZ` poses the camera after the settle wait and before the screenshot. `--timeout` (before the subcommand, default 15 seconds) sets how long to wait for each command and for the PNG to appear. The exit code is 0 only if every step succeeded, 1 if a step failed or timed out, and 2 if the harness is not enabled (`run.py` prints `harness not enabled at <dir>; run 'run.py enable' and relaunch the game`).

An unknown command, malformed JSON, or a missing or empty `path` logs `DevHarness: rejected '<file>': <reason>` and moves the file to `rejected/` without touching game state. A command that parses but fails while running logs an error and the game keeps running.

The paths in `load-level` and `screenshot` are interpreted by the game process, so `run.py` converts them (see below).

## Launching under CrossOver

Starting the game with `task game:run` opens the CrossOver Steam client, which in testing did not always go on to launch Megabonk. The harness cycle was verified by launching the executable directly in the Steam bottle while the Steam client is running:

```sh
cd "<game dir>"
SteamAppId=3405340 SteamGameId=3405340 \
  /Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOver/bin/wine --bottle Steam --cx-app Megabonk.exe
```

### Relaunching

Quit the previous launch before starting a new one. A second instance fights the first over the log file and the harness command folder, and a rebuilt mod DLL is only picked up on a fresh launch.

```sh
uv run scripts/run.py quit
```

`quit` sends the quit command and then blocks until the game process has exited, so the next launch can follow immediately. It prints `quit: game exited` and exits 0. It exits 1 if the command is not accepted or the process is still alive after `--timeout` seconds (default 15), and it prints the remaining pids. If no game process is running it prints `quit: game not running` and exits 0, so it is safe to run before every launch. `run.py cycle` ends with the same quit-and-wait step.

Process detection uses the standard library only: `ps -axo pid=,command=` on macOS and Linux, `tasklist` on Windows (not exercised on a Windows host). A process counts as the game only when its command line starts with the game executable, `...\Megabonk.exe` under Wine or `Megabonk.x86_64` natively. Helpers that mention the executable, such as `winewrapper.exe`, `UnityCrashHandler64.exe`, `winemenubuilder.exe` and a shell running the launch command, are ignored. If `quit` times out because the game is hung, end it by the pid it printed.

Caveats:

- `load-level` needs Steamworks, because the loader reads the app build id. A direct launch without `SteamAppId` fails with `Steamworks is not initialized`.
- The game sees the host filesystem as the `Z:` drive. `run.py` rewrites host paths to `Z:\...` on macOS, so pass ordinary host paths.
- `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot(path)` and `ImageConversion.EncodeToPNG` both fail inside Il2CppInterop in this game build, and `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotAsTexture` is unusable for the same reason. The harness reads the finished frame with `Texture2D.ReadPixels` at the end of the frame and encodes the PNG itself (`png_encoder.cs`).
- The screenshot is the game's own frame at the game's render resolution, not a capture of the host screen.
- Localhost networking was not tested; the file-drop channel needs only `System.IO`.

## Freezing gameplay

`freeze` calls `MyTime.Pause()` and `resume` calls `MyTime.Unpause()`, the game's own time path, and each logs `MyTime.paused`. This is not `PauseUi.Pause()`, so no pause window appears in the frame. While frozen the run timer, enemies and the player stop, so an idle player cannot die. The harness still polls (MelonLoader's `OnUpdate` does not use the game's clock) and the screen still renders: clouds, grass and particles keep moving between two frozen screenshots, while the HUD timer, enemies and player do not.

Caveats:

- Freezing stops enemies as well, so it suits screenshots only and cannot stand in for a playthrough.
- Freeze after the settle wait, not before it: a level-up dialog that is already open stays open.
- Resuming continues the run from where it stopped.

## Camera pose

`camera` holds the camera at a world-space position and euler rotation in degrees (Unity convention: `rotation` `[90,0,0]` looks straight down). The game recomputes the camera each frame, so the mod stores the pose and re-applies it to `PlayerCamera.Instance.camera.transform` from `OnLateUpdate`, after the game's own update. Verified in the running game: the pose held for more than 6 seconds of live gameplay and while frozen.

On Forest, cell (x, z) is at world `(-280 + 40x, 20 * height, -280 + 40z)`, from `MapParameters.scaledTileWidth` and `scaledTileHeight`.

`camera-clear` restores the camera's local position and rotation saved when the override first applied. The game never rewrites that transform itself, so without the restore the camera would stay at the posed view.

Caveats:

- Fog hides the map from far above: at y=400 the frame is a flat blue field, at y=150 the map is washed out, and at y=60 it is clear. Pose within roughly 150 units of the ground.
- The player keeps playing under the override, so combine it with `freeze` for a still scene.
- The camera pose changes the picture only; use `invulnerable` to keep the player alive for an enemy playthrough.

## Player invulnerability

`invulnerable` gives the player 20 stacks of the game's own Mirror item (`EItem.Mirror`) and sets the item's `cooldown` and `minCooldown` to 0. Mirror stops a hit through `PlayerHealth.A_CheckStopDamage` and normally waits out a cooldown before it can stop the next one; with no cooldown it stops every hit. `vulnerable` removes the item and restores the Mirror amount the player had before. Each command logs `DevHarness: player invulnerable, Mirror amount=20.` or the `vulnerable` equivalent. Issuing the same command twice logs `already invulnerable` or `already vulnerable` and changes nothing. A new run builds a new inventory, so send `invulnerable` again after each `load`.

Verified in the running game on a mod-loaded Forest level: an idle player kept full HP and shield for 47 seconds of game time while kills went from 6 to 51. Setting only the stacks, with the default cooldown, was not enough: HP fell to 36/72 within 40 seconds.

Caveats:

- It is not a god mode. Damage that does not go through `A_CheckStopDamage` is still applied, and stronger enemies such as mini bosses can still kill the player. Which damage sources bypass Mirror was not enumerated.
- Mirror reflects damage back at the attacker, so enemies take damage from hitting the player.
- A surviving, idle player can still reach the level-up dialog, which pauses play and puts a window in the frame. `freeze` after the settle wait does not close it, so keep the settle time short or take the screenshot before the first level-up.
- The kill floor still wins. `KillFloorWatcher` ends a fall through `PlayerHealth.KillPlayer()`, which does not pass through the damage check. Verified with a level that removes every tile but one: the invulnerable player logged `KillFloor: player fell to y=-49.8, killing` and the run ended on the death screen.

## Kill-floor heartbeat

The kill floor (see "Kill floor" in [runtime-map-structure.md](runtime-map-structure.md)) logs a line for every actor it kills. The heartbeat adds a second line every 5 seconds that says what the watcher can see, which is what to read when something that should have died did not:

```text
KillFloor: watch enemies=26 stageBosses=1 lowestEnemyY=-69.03 lowestBossY=-66.47 bosses=['Enemy1(Clone)' id=18 y=-66.2 lowest=-66.4 inEnemies=True]
```

`enemies` is the size of `EnemyManager.enemies` and `stageBosses` the size of the manager's stage boss list. `lowestEnemyY` and `lowestBossY` are the lowest point (pivot or collider bottom, whichever is lower) any enemy or boss reached since the previous heartbeat, and each boss entry gives its id, pivot `y`, current `lowest` point, and whether it is also in `enemies`. A boss is only identified by id, because it has the same `Enemy1(Clone)` name as every other enemy.

It is off by default, because it adds a line every 5 seconds. Turn it on with `run.py heartbeat on` and off with `run.py heartbeat off`; both log `KillFloor: heartbeat on` or `off` and apply at once, including to a level that is already running. To start with it on, set `MEGABONK_KILL_FLOOR_HEARTBEAT` to `1` or `true` in the environment of the game process, for example in the `.env` that the taskfile reads or in front of the launch command. The variable is read once when the mod loads, and a later command overrides it. Verified in the game that the variable reaches the process under CrossOver.

The kill line itself always carries the actor's id, world position and `lowest` point, with `(still present, attempt N)` appended when an actor stays in the game after a kill.

## Not covered

The harness does not skip the level-up dialog, move the player, or press menu buttons. Use `freeze` to stop an idle player dying during a screenshot, or `invulnerable` when enemies must keep moving.

## Character selection

A level started through the mod (`LevelLoaderPatch.LoadAndStart`, used by F6 and `load-level`) spawns Tony McZoom. The loader assigns the static `CharacterMenu.selectedCharacter` (ECharacter 13) just before `MapController.StartNewMap`; the player spawn reads that static, so no `RunConfig` field is involved. `Preferences.selectedCharacter` is the saved setting and is never written: after a mod-loaded run `Saves/LocalDir/config.json` still holds the player's own choice.

If the assignment throws, `CharacterOverride.TryApply` returns a warning that the loader logs, and the run starts with the character the menu last selected. The id lives in `character_override.cs` and mirrors `ECharacter.TonyMcZoom` in the il2cpp dump.

To confirm which character spawned, run `run.py cycle` and read the screenshot; the saved character in `config.json` differs from the one on screen when the override works.
